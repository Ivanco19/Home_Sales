# Home_Sales

## Description:

 This challenge is focused on optimizing queries and enhancing performance in analyzing home sales data using PySpark. Leveraging SparkSQL, I delved into key metrics and implemented various querie, utilizing temporary views, partitioning data, and experimenting with caching strategies for a temporary table.

## Key Features:

* Analysis of home sales data using SparkSQL.
* Creation of temporary views to facilitate complex queries.
* Partitioning data to streamline processing.
* Experimentation with caching and uncaching of temporary tables.

## Performance Insights:

A notable discovery emerged during the project â€“ leveraging the cache of a temporary view significantly improves query execution times.
